        <h2>Seamus and Louise</h2>
        <p>"Everyone was talking about Eileen’s beautiful singing all day. She sang all of our favourite songs including a really obscure Leonard Cohen one that she just happened to know! Her version of An raibh tu ar an gcarrig was absolutely phenomenal. She made the ceremony so special and was professional and extremely helpful throughout the process. Thanks so much for making the ceremony so memorable Eileen."</p>

        <h2>Fran and Alfredo</h2>
        <p>"Eileen made our wedding very special and brought the house down!. Her voice is spectacular and can adapt to any genre. We wanted a singer who could blend the traditional with the contemporary and she delivered. She sang some of our favourites (Nick Cave, Neil Young, etc) and made them church appropriate. She also sang the traditional wedding service songs such as Ave Maria (Schubert), her voice is very emotive. Eileen was very hands on from the start to make sure we got exactly what we wanted from our wedding music. My only regret is I didn't get her to sing at the reception!"</p>

        <p>
"Just a quick note to say a huge thank you to you and your musicians for playing at our wedding in Bansha Church. We really enjoyed the ceremony, thanks in no small part to the wonderful music you played. We had so many comments afterwards on the music, and in particular everyone loved your Ave Maria. Thanks also for allowing my niece Efa to sing, and for all the help and encouragement you and your team gave her on the morning of the wedding. I really do appreciate that! We will certainly be recommending you to our friends!"
